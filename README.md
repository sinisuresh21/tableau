# Tableau - Visualization of World Migration 1950-2100

This project aims to visualize the migration of people across the globe from 1950-2015 and estimated migration from 2015-2100. This is achieved by using the application Tableau 2020.3. This project intends to display the change in migration over the years through a world map and also visualize the migrate rate among the developed and less- developed countries. Another view of the migration is among the high income and low income countries.
The data utilized for this project is from the database: UN: Net Migration Rate on data.world. Data visualization best practices have been followed throughout the project which is described in the sections below.
The data is divided into two categories depicting migration over the years 1950-2015 and 2015-2100. Users can toggle between these two dashboards with ease using a click of the button.
