This project aims to visualize the migration of people across the globe from 1950-2015 and estimated migration from 2015-2100. This is achieved by using the application Tableau 2020.3. This project intends to display the change in migration over the years through a world map and also visualize the migrate rate among the developed and less- developed countries. Another view of the migration is among the high income and low income countries.
